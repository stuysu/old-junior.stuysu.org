* `npm run dev`

## Environment Variables

It's easiest to make a `.env` file to use these locally.

| Name | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| **PORT** | what port to run on (default is 3001) |
| **DATABASE_LOAD** | describes how to load the Sequelize ORM (force, alter) |
| **DATABASE_URL** | a database url to use (default is a SQLite DB at ./app.db) |
| **LOG** | if the database should log (default is no logging) |
| **AUTHENTICATION_MODE**| Change the admin panel authentication mode in development: <ul><li><b>full</b>- uses google to sign in and checks for a valid email address.</li><li><b>show</b>- uses google to sign in and doesn't check for a valid email address.</li><li><b>skip</b>(or anything not above)- doesn't work through google -- force loads admin panel</li><li><i>default is full authentication ("full")</i></li></ul> |
| **CLIENT_ID** | the google api client id for the google admin panel authentication (not necessary if AUTH_MODE is set to not use google) |
| **CLIENT_SECRET**| the google api client secret for google authentication |
| **ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET** | the signuture of the JWTs distrubted for authorization |

## Setup

* Install project
* Create `.env` file with `AUTHENTICATION_MODE=skip`
* `npm run dev`
* Add CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET to test google authentication and JWT authorization with AUTHENTICATION_MODE=show or full

## Setup a Migration

[Documentation for Sequelize Migrations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html)

[Documentation for queryInterface](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/dialects/abstract/query-interface.js~QueryInterface.html)

* Run `npx sequelize migration:create --name=[name]`
* Edit the new file created in `/migrations`
* Add a list of commands to the up function which will update the database
* Add a list of commands to the down function which will revert the database back to its original state
* Commit and push

## Todo

* Better study guide and event interface for admin page
* Add newsletter on admin panel and frontend
* Timezones are messed up between local and remote website (e.g. event interface, consider using Date datatype in the models)
* Redesign error page
* Clean api response code (especially study guides)
* Not all of the alerts actually respond to what the server is saying (add more consistent responses and frontend error handlers)
* Document code + add READMEs to each folder
* Figure out best way to handle sequelize errors
